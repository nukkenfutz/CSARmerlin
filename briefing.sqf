_adm = player createDiaryRecord ["diary", ["Administration","
The fugitives' approximate positions will be updated on the map at a regular interval.
<br/><br/>
ATTENTION: The indigenous blocking forces are zealously anti-Russian, bloodthirsty, and barely competent. They will shoot any uncuffed detainee or fugitive on sight.

COMMANDER'S INTENT
<br/>
The fugitives are equipped with emergency beacons so the Russians can find them, but we can track them as well. Use these indicators to locate them, then bring them to Sebjan airfield. Don't hesitate to defend yourself, but take care to identify potential targets.
<br/><br/>
MOVEMENT PLAN
<br/>
Utilize the trucks' speed and bright headlights, but you'll need to dismount to search thoroughly and capture the targets.
<br/><br/>
SUPPORT
<br/>
An indigenous blocking force has been placed along the coastline to ensure fugitives do not cross the Tara Strait into the rest of Namalsk.
<br/><br/>
SPECIAL TASKS
<br/>
You've all been issued 2 cable ties, non-reusable. Use them to capture fugitives or subdued combatants. Fugitives are priority.
"]];

_mis = player createDiaryRecord ["diary", ["Mission","
Capture the fugitives alive. Use of deadly force is authorized against opposition.
"]];

_sit = player createDiaryRecord ["diary", ["Situation","
A treasonous sub-human 'whistleblower' has defected with the aid of Russian sleeper agents. Due to unknown circumstances, the helicopter carrying them on the last leg of the journey crashed on the southeast peninsula of Tara in newly US-occupied Namalsk. The traitor and his accomplices must be captured in the interest of national security and brought to justice in Guantanamo Bay before it's closed.
<br/><br/>
ENEMY FORCES
<br/>
There is little doubt that the Russians will attempt a discrete rescue.
<br/><br/>
FRIENDLY FORCES
<br/>
Local recruits with spotlights and machineguns. They're jumpy, unreliable, and prone to shoot anything without our uniform on.
